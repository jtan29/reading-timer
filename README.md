# My Personal Project

## Reading time tracker

**Proposed features:**
- ways to store a text's name, associated genre, and
word count (provided by the user)
- ways to track multiple texts at the same time
- in-app timer
- calculation of *estimated* reading speed using logged time
- calculation of *estimated* reading time for given word count and genre, using
the calculated reading speed from other tesxts
- options to manually adjust logged time

**Users:**

- people interested in improving reading speed
- people interested in estimating time needed to complete
reading a given text
- people interested in tracking how much time they spend reading

**Why:**

* reading/writing is one of my hobbies, and something that I wish
I had when reading was a way to keep track of how long it took me to finish
a particular book or other text, and how this time frame could vary depending on the genre.
Additionally, I could see this being useful to estimate the time that should be alloted
to reading a specific text.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add and 
remove texts from a list of texts currently be tracked.
- As a user, I want to know the total time I spent reading
on a specific text.
- As a user, I want to know my mean reading speed on a text.
- As a user, I want to know my mean reading
speed over multiple texts.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark when I have finished reading
a text, so that the reading speed can be calculated.
- As a user, I want to provide a category for a text
(graphic novel, novel, short story, non-fictional, class reading etc.)
- As a user, I want to be able to estimate the time 
needed to finish reading a text using data 
from selected previously completed texts.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my texts, with their word counts, genres, and recorded times, to a file
- As a user, I want to be able to load my texts (with their details) from a file when launching the app, allowing
recording to resume
